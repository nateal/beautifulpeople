Create a simple CRUD (Create, Run, Update, Delete) application created in NodeJS.
The restriction will be as follows:

  a. Library to use is only Mysql, EJS, and Express.

  Note: Helper libraries are allowed as long as it doesn’t drastically change the outcome of the program.

  b. Create a RESTful API that can return JSON or consume API call.

  Note: RESTful means -> GET, POST, DELETE, PUT endpoints must be created.

  c. Create a database called “inventory", with table “items”, with columns (id, name, qty, amount)

  Note: CRUD will go around “items” table.

  d. Must be uploaded in Github with iterative commits. This is to know their journey building the application.
